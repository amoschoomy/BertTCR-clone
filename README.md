# BertTCR
A deep learning framework for prediction of cancer-related immune status based on T cell receptor repertoires. This framework utilizes pre-trained protein-BERT models to embed sequences, followed by predictors combining multiple-instance learning (MIL), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and ensemble learning(EL) to forecast immune status. It includes two classifiers: one for accurately distinguishing between cancer patients and healthy individuals using a binary classification model, and another for discriminating between specific cancer types or healthy status using a multi-class classification model. Additionally, the framework provides corresponding immune state evaluation strategies.For more details, please read our paper.
